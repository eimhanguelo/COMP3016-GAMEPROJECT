3D Car Racing Game - OpenGL Project

Welcome to the GitHub repository for an immersive 3D car racing game developed using C++ and OpenGL. This project exemplifies cutting-edge graphics programming, physics simulation, and interactive gameplay design.

Overview
This project aims to deliver a visually stunning and engaging car racing experience. Players control a car navigating a dynamic racetrack while collecting coins and avoiding obstacles. The game employs advanced rendering techniques, realistic physics, and interactive sound effects to provide a truly immersive experience.

Features
- Real-time 3D graphics powered by OpenGL 4.x.
- Dynamic lighting with Blinn-Phong and Physically-Based Rendering (PBR).
- Interactive gameplay mechanics, including car control, coin collection, and collision detection.
- Realistic audio integration for engine sounds, collisions, and background music.
- User-friendly interface with intuitive keyboard and mouse controls.
